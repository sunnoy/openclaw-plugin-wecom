[简体中文](https://github.com/sunnoy/openclaw-plugin-wecom/blob/main/README.md) | [English](https://github.com/sunnoy/openclaw-plugin-wecom/blob/main/README_EN.md)

`openclaw-plugin-wecom` is an enterprise WeChat (WeCom) integration plugin specifically developed for the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/sunnoy/openclaw-plugin-wecom) framework. It allows you to seamlessly integrate powerful AI capabilities into WeCom with support for multiple advanced features.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🌊 **Streaming Output**: Based on the latest WeCom AI Bot streaming mechanism for a smooth typing-like response experience.
- 🤖 **Dynamic Agent Management**: Automatically creates independent Agent instances for each direct message user and group chat. Each instance has its own workspace, configurations, and conversation history, ensuring data isolation and security.
- 👥 **Deep Group Chat Integration**: Supports group message parsing and precise triggering via @mentions.
- 🛠️ **Enhanced Commands**: Built-in support for common commands (e.g., `/new` for a new session, `/status` to check status) with command allowlist configuration.
- 🔒 **Security & Authentication**: Full support for WeCom message encryption/decryption, URL verification, and sender identity validation.
- ⚡ **High-Performance Async Processing**: Uses an asynchronous message processing architecture to ensure high responsiveness of the WeCom gateway even during long-running AI inference.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Plugin

Run the following in your OpenClaw project directory:

```bash
npm install openclaw-plugin-wecom
```

### 2. Configure Plugin

Add the plugin configuration to your OpenClaw configuration file (e.g., `config.json`):

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "wxwork": {

      "token": "YOUR_TOKEN",
      "encodingAesKey": "YOUR_ENCODING_AES_KEY",
